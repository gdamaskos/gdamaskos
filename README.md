Software Engineer that turned into DevOps Engineer in the Cyber Security sector. I enjoy setting up, configuring and maintaining a healthy Linux ecosystem leveraging Infrastructure-as-Code tools.

Currently, I am expanding my skills in AWS cloud management and configuration using Terraform.

Previously, I reorganized crystallography research results in a Linux database server and developed a user friendly web application to make the data publicly available.
I work well as a part of a team and I am also self-organized, so that I can work independently.

I have a background in Neuroscience and keep track of latest advances in the field.

My dream is to take part in shaping the future of free software and actively support digital liberties community.
