Enthusiastic computer scientist with 4+ years of experience developing
websites that facilitate scientific breakthroughs by offering research tools. My
goal is to deliver clean, maintainable, scalable and well documented code to
the leading companies in the field.


In previous roles, I successfully redeveloped the main application of my group
by converting it into a cutting edge modern web application and published
PhD results after organizing them in databases. I work well as part of a team
but also independently and I have high sense of responsibility. 

My dream is to take part in shaping the future of free software and actively support digital liberties community.

My hobbies are chess and yoga.
